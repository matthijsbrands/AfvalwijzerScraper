# AfvalwijzerScraper
The afvalwijzer site is a handy tool to see when and what trash is going to be picked up (if your municipality use it), but they haven't added functionality to add the dates to a web calendar of your choice.
That is why i created this scraper to get the dates and add them to Google Calendar.

It uses the following dependencies:
- Google Calendar API v3
- Selenium Chrome Webdriver
